# Dot Files

This repository is meant to store my dot files ( e.g. bash and terminal configurations ), meant to be used from one computer to another. Here are a few links and tips that might be helpful:

### homebrew

In Terminal:

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### python3 | pip

Install `python3` and `pip3` via the following:

```sh
brew install python3
```

In `~/.bash_profile`, the following aliases will be helpful:

```sh
# Use python3 as the default.
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
```
